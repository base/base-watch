# base-watch [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/base-watch.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base-watch) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/node-base/base-watch.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/node-base/base-watch)

> Watch plugin for base applications.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm i base-watch --save
```

**Heads up** this plugin requires the [base-tasks][] plugin to be registered first.

## Usage

```js
var watch = require('base-watch');

var Base = require('base');
var base = new Base();

base.use(watch());
```

**[assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core)**

This plugin is already included in [assemble](http://assemble.io), but if you're using [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) you can add the plugin like this:

```js
var watch = require('base-watch');

var assemble = require('assemble-core');
var app = assemble();

app.use(watch());
```

## API

If no task(s) or function is specified, only the instance of `FSWatcher` is returned and can be used directly.
See [chokidar.watch](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api) for more information.

* `returns` **{Function}**: Returns the plugin function to be used in a [base][] application.

**Example**

```js
app.use(watch());
```

### [watch](index.js#L48)

Watch a file, directory, or glob pattern for changes and build a task or list of tasks when changes are made. Watch is powered by [chokidar][] so arguments can be anything supported by [chokidar.watch](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api).

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Filename, Directory name, or glob pattern to watch
* `options` **{Object}**: Additional options to be passed to [chokidar][]
* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: Tasks that are passed to `.build` when files in the glob are changed.
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an instance of `FSWatcher` from [chokidar][]

**Example**

```js
var watcher = app.watch('templates/pages/*.hbs', ['site']);
```
