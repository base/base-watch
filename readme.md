> Watch plugin for base applications.

**Heads up** this plugin should be used with [base-tasks][].

## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm i base-watch --save
```

## Usage

```js
var watch = require('base-watch');
```

## API

### [.plugin](index.js#L28)
Adds a [watch](#watch) method to your app that takes a file, directory, or glob pattern and watches for changes to those files. When a change occurs, the specified task(s) or function will execute.

If no task(s) or function is specified, only the instance of `FSWatcher` is returned and can be used directly.
See [chokidar.watch](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api) for more information.

* `returns` **{Function}**: plugin function to be used in a [base][] application.  


**Example**



```js
app.use(watch());
```


### [watch](index.js#L50)
Watch a file, directory, or glob pattern for changes and build a task or list of tasks when changes are made. Watch is powered by [chokidar][] so arguments can be anything supported by [chokidar.watch](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api).


**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Filename, Directory name, or glob pattern to watch    
* `options` **{Object}**: Additional options to be passed to [chokidar][]    
* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: Tasks that are passed to `.build` when files in the glob are changed.    
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an instance of `FSWatcher` from [chokidar][]  


**Example**



```js
var watcher = app.watch('templates/pages/*.hbs', ['site']);
```
